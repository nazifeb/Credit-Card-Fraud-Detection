# Credit Card Fraud Detection 💳🛡️

This project explores machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

### 🔍 Challenge: Class Imbalance
The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only **0.172%** of all transactions. This requires special handling such as specialized metrics (Precision-Recall) or resampling techniques.

### 🚀 Implementation Highlights
- **Automated Data Sourcing:** Uses `kagglehub` for seamless dataset integration.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing transaction distributions and identifying anomalies.
- **Preprocessing:** Scaling features and handling high-dimensionality.
- **Modeling:** Implementing classification algorithms to identify fraudulent patterns.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Kagglehub
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

### 📊 Dataset
The dataset can be found on Kaggle: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
